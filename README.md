## Description

This study guide is a full stack app that uses NextJs, Mongodb, Prisma and Node. It allows anyone who knows the password to be able to input useful terms and conditions for future use. It also gives the user the ability to sort and see options based on which category they're looking for. For example, if we're looking to review common Leetcode terms and tricks, the user has the ability to search for this.

This was a fun app to do and a great refresher for designing clean, responsive, forms and tables. Anytime we're able to build CRUD applications and cement the basics of web development further into our brains, the better off we will be.

## Features

This app features a table of all terms entered throughout the life of the app (unless deleted). You also have the ability to enter new terms, but it's minimally protected by a secret passphrase that only the insiders have access to. As with all CRUD apps, you also have the ability to edit items too. One thing I really wanted to do with this app was include pagination in our terms table as well as a sort by feature. Those are things I haven't needed to do before in an app and was a solid foundation in which to build on.
